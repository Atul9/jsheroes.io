          <p>Elm is a cutting-edge functional programming language that you can use either in place of JavaScript, or alongside it. Its amazing compiler catches errors before you even run your code—so effectively that Elm code has a reputation for never crashing.</p>
          <p>Come join us and learn how to build Elm applications from zero to production-ready. Find out why people say that learning Elm changed the way they wrote code in other languages for the better!</p>

        description: `
        <p>GraphQL provides a front-end-developer-centric data interface that can unify all of your data sources – including multiple databases and web APIs – in a single intuitive API. Using the Apollo framework, we also get in-memory client-side caching and a simple development environment.</p>

        <p>
        In this fundamental class, we'll cover:
        <ul>
          <li>GraphQL and front-end-centric data management</li>
          <li>An overview of popular GraphQL open source projects: Relay, Apollo, GraphiQL</li>
          <li>Queries, mutations, schemas, and resolvers</li>
          <li>Apollo server in a Node.js app</li>
          <li>Managing GraphQL queries on the client using higher-order React components and Apollo</li>
          <li>Merging a REST endpoint and database responses into a single GraphQL query</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>The course is totally hands-on; you’ll be coding right from the start. You’ll learn 10x more by doing than you would by watching slides. We’ll build an app designed to cover all of the essential areas for building real applications with GraphQL, dealing with real-world issues that we’ve encountered working with large and complex apps for OK GROW!’s clients. At each step you’ll be taught the concept, given the next goal and the basic outline of the solution, and you’ll work to build the next feature into your own version of the app with one-on-one guidance from the instructors.</p>
        
        <p>Then we’ll regroup and explore the instructors’ solution (which you have access to on GitHub). At the end you’ll have your own working version of the app plus the instructors’ version.</p>

        description: `
          <p>Starting from scratch, we will implement several common mobile UI patterns that depend on gestures and/or animations so that you can become comfortable with React Native's "Animated" API (which also works on the web!) and react-native-gesture-handler. Even if you don't have a use case for React Native, this may be useful to generally learn more about gestures and animations. We will use create-react-native-app, or if you prefer to not install anything, you can use https://snack.expo.io directly from your browser.</p>

          <p>Tests are more than a quality trait of your code that you can’t forgo, it's all about confidence. You simply cannot afford going into production without be sure that your software doing what you think it does and will continue to do so as you enrich functionality. But sometimes, testing UI components, instead of providing a confidence makes us feel upset and even unproductive. Join Marianna Etelson for a half-day workshop on testing your React-Redux applications. You will learn how to write Unit and Integration tests, what are their scopes, and the tool-set required to properly bootstrap a project for test coverage. Amongst the tools we will use: jsdom, enzyme, proxiqure and tape.</p>
