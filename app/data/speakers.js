      description: `
        <p>Design systems are playing an ever-increasing role in allowing us to produce world-class design at scale. However, for these systems to truly deliver on their potential, they need to be properly integrated into the rest of the organisation, speaking the same language as those building and delivering products to our end users.</p>
        <p>As a result, we're beginning to see the rise of Design Operations ("DesignOps" for short) within companies like Salesforce, Airbnb and SEEK, with dedicated engineering resources being embedded within teams that historically would have only contained designers. By focusing developers entirely on translating a company's design language into production-ready code and monitoring its real-world effectiveness, we can empower our design teams to deliver high quality design across large organisations at a pace that simply wasn't previously possible.</p>
        <p>But what does DesignOps look like in practice? How do we ensure developers and designers are speaking the same language? What should your organisation expect from such a fundamental shift in perspective, and how do we measure success? Together, we'll examine the benefits, challenges and future potential of this approach through the real-life experiences of an engineer who's been living in a design team for the past year.</p>`,

          <li>An overview of popular GraphQL open source projects: Relay, Apollo, GraphiQL</li>

We’ll build an app designed to cover all of the essential areas for building real applications with GraphQL, dealing with real-world issues that we’ve encountered working with large and complex apps for OK GROW!’s clients. At each step you’ll be taught the concept, given the next goal and the basic outline of the solution, and you’ll work to build the next feature into your own version of the app with one-on-one guidance from the instructors.</p>
        <p>Then we’ll regroup and explore the instructors’ solution (which you have access to on GitHub). At the end you’ll have your own working version of the app plus the instructors’ version.</p>
